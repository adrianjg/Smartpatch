#Smartpatch

Repository for the UROP Fall 2014 project.

The idea will be to read data from an AR marker, process it, and display it onscreen as AR. The data will be an anemia test. Smartpatch is part of the "big three", along with Flowmeter and Dipstick.

The big three were part of the published paper in 2016, "Development of Smart Phone Tools for Printed Diagnostics: Challenges and Solutions".

Big thanks to Dr. Richard Fletcher!
